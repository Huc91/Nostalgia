# Nostalgia
I was feeling nostalgic about the dial up modem era so I made this python program.

Everytime you'll connect to the internet the sound of a modem that is dialing-up will blast from your computer speakers.<br/> 
Beware of nostalgic feels

## INSTALL
1. Put the oldschool.py in a startup crontab
2. Enjoy

## WARNING
